# AN with BLUEFOX Nodes

This is a Fork from [AnimationNodes](https://github.com/JacquesLucke/animation_nodes) created by Jacques Luke. This branch also includes nodes from AN+EN([3DSinghVFX](https://github.com/3DSinghVFX/animation_nodes/tree/extranodes)). I have added few new nodes which improved my overall experience in Animation nodes. This branch is purely experimental. So if you encounter any difficulties please report in issues section.

 ## Extra Falloffs 
- **Radial Falloff** - similar to radial field in c4d
-  **Wave Falloff** - creates different forms of waves or ripples like sine, square, triangular, saw. 
 - **Texture Falloff** - falloff based on texture
 - **Formula Falloff** - creates falloff based on mathematical expressions
 -  **Memory Falloff** - stores previous state of falloff
## Effectors

- **Inheritance Effector** - inherit between matrices or vectors. Can be used for effects like morphing
-  **Step Effector** - similar to step effector in c4d
## Other Nodes

- **Spline Tracer** - creates spline path from moving vector
- **Curl Noise** - generates curly noise
- **Dupli Instancer** -  creates instances of objects
-  **Marching Cubes** - mesh generation from scalar field
- **Color Mix 2** - vectorized inputs and Blending Modes
- **Fibonacci** - 
- **Spherical Spiral**  - 
- **Lorenz Attractor** - 
- **Bmesh Smooth** - 
- **Memory Node** - 
- **Random Color** -
