# AN with BLUEFOX Nodes

This is a Fork from [AnimationNodes](https://github.com/JacquesLucke/animation_nodes) created by Jacques Luke. This branch also includes nodes from AN+EN([3DSinghVFX](https://github.com/3DSinghVFX/animation_nodes/tree/extranodes)). I have added few new nodes which improved my overall experience in Animation nodes. This branch is purely experimental so you may experience bugs. Please report those in issues section.
