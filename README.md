# AN with BLUEFOX Nodes

This is a Fork from [AnimationNodes](https://github.com/JacquesLucke/animation_nodes) created by Jacques Luke. This branch also includes nodes from AN+EN([3DSinghVFX](https://github.com/3DSinghVFX/animation_nodes/tree/extranodes)). I have added few new nodes which improved my overall experience in Animation nodes. This branch is purely experimental so you may experience errors, bugs etc. Please report those in issues section.
